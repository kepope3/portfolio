      <p>Hi there and thanks for visiting my site!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Keith, I moved to Newquay, Cornwall when I was 21 and
        absolutely fell in love with the lifestyle, the waves, the surf, the
        coastal path, the travelling atmosphere, the great people and even the
        seagulls...
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved this place so much that I left for three years to study at
        university so that I could live here comfortably all year round. During
        my time at University I found that programming unlocked creativity and
        passion which I didn't know I had.
      </p>

        Coding now is as big a part of my life than just about anything else and
        has also allowed me to live and work in the place that I love.
