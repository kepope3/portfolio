      <p>Hi there and thanks for visiting my site!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Keith and I love to code - place a problem in front of me and
        I will become obsessed with it until it is complete with excellence. I
        thoroughly enjoy a good challenge, and I consider the best way of
        finding and coding the most suitable solution is through good team-work
        and dedication.

        My three years at university gave me a solid foundation to work from,
        but it wasn't until I entered the industry that I put all the pieces
        together, and learned what it involves to become a good developer.

        I am an advocate of clean code and architecture and believe that code
        should be simple, elegant, easily maintainable and extensible. Careful
        thought and consideration should take effect before writing any code at
        all.
      </p>

        You should face every story with an open mind and consider all
        possibilities. The best way to do this is by working closely within a
        team. Teams should discuss and come to shared results to find the most
        suitable solutions and to meet best practices.
