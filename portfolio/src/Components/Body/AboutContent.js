        The station is one of the most remote in the United Kingdom, at an
        isolated location on the northern edge of Rannoch Moor.[5] The station
        is not accessible by any public roads. The nearest road, the B846 road
        from Loch Rannoch to Rannoch station, is a ten-mile (16 km) walk away by
        hill track,[6] although Rannoch station itself is only 7¼ route-miles
        (11.5 km) away by rail.[7] Vehicular access is by a 15-mile (24km)
        private road from a little west of Moy Lodge on the A86. Until the late
        1980s, the only electrical power at the station was provided by
        batteries. The only telephone was the railway's system which linked
        Corrour only to the adjacent signalboxes at Rannoch and Tulloch, which
        were on the public telephone system.[8] At 1,340 ft (408 m) above sea
        level[4] the station provides a starting point for hill-walkers and
        Munro-baggers. There is accommodation and a bar/restaurant available at
        the station[9] and an SYHA youth hostel just over a mile (2 km) away at
        the head of Loch Ossian.[10] The station was the starting point of the
        last journey of the "Man with no Name", whose body was found in 1996 on
        Ben Alder and only identified some years later.[11]
